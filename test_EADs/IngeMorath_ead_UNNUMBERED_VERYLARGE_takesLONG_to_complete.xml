    <head>Inge Morath (1923-2002)</head>
<p>Inge Morath was born in Graz, Austria, in 1923. After studying languages in Berlin, she became a translator, then a journalist and the Austrian editor for <title>Heute</title>, an Information Service Branch publication based in Munich. All her life, Morath would remain a prolific diarist and letter-writer.
 
A friend of photographer Ernst Haas, she wrote articles to accompany his photographs and was invited by Robert Capa and Haas to Paris to join the newly founded Magnum agency as an editor and researcher. She began photographing in London in 1951, and joined Magnum Photos as a photographer in 1953. While working on her own first assignments, Morath also assisted Henri Cartier-Bresson during 1953-54, becoming a full member in 1955.
 
In the following years, Morath traveled extensively in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Her special interest in the arts found expression in photographic essays published by a number of leading magazines. After her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller in 1962, Morath settled in New York and Connecticut. She first visited the USSR in 1965. In 1972 she studied Mandarin and obtained a visa to China, making the first of many trips to the country in 1978.
 
Much of Morath's most important work consists of portraits, but of passers-by as well as celebrities. She was also adept at photographing places: her pictures of Boris Pasternak's home, Pushkin's library, Chekhov's house, Mao Zedong's bedroom, artists' studios and cemetery memorials are permeated with the spirit of invisible people still present. Inge Morath died in New York City on 30 January 2002.

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections as they are acquired, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p><p>Information included in the Description of Papers note and Collection Contents section is drawn from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, library staff supplied folder titles during initial processing.</p><p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p><p>Before its sale to the Library, the Inge Morath Foundation housed and administered the bulk of the collection at its administrative office in New York City. A small portion of the collection came from the Miller-Morath residence in Roxbury, Connecticut.</p><p>Boxes 720 and 721 are unused. Original videocassettes are now housed in box 719.

The captions document her travel, projects, assignments, and subjects of interest. Depending on the story, the captions vary from brief to in-depth descriptions.</p><p>Morath and other Magnum Photos photographers assigned chronological story numbers to their projects. These numbers consist of digits for the year of image creation, followed by a sequential number for the story (assignment, job, or project) within the given year, and then often by numbers that identify the roll and exposure frame. The captions for individual story numbers include descriptions from roll to roll and often from exposure frame to frame.</p><p>The caption files for discrete story numbers may also contain related correspondence, essays, lists, notes, clippings, brochures, maps, and ephemera.</p><p>The sets of captions include duplicates and photocopies. Story lists and indices often accompany captions and provide multiple story numbers for a specific year, which document story numbers Morath used for a single project.</p><p>Notes in the guide for this group of material include descriptive inscriptions accompanying the captions.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_c83f338a54d580ee4e5761821c55bdf9"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Organized under two headings: Personal Set and Magnum New York Set.</p></arrangement><relatedmaterial id="aspace_739eb14032926eebde54189b6d803a6e"><head>Related Archival Materials note</head><p>Associated materials: A nearly complete representation of images described by the captions can be found in Series I.
